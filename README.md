# [WORK IN PROGRESS] QuickMAL
A simple tool in your browser to make changes to your [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) entries faster, developed in [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/). This app is not meant for commercial use for now, and this repo mainly serves as a proof-of-concept, and is something that I can improve and add features to in the future.
